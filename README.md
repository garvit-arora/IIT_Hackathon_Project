# Hackathon Prototype: Estimated Cost Breakdown

## üìä Estimated Cost Overview

This document provides an estimated breakdown of the costs involved in developing and deploying our hackathon project. The estimates include development, tools, cloud hosting, hardware, and miscellaneous costs.

## 1. üíª **Development Costs**
- **In-house development**:  
  - Estimated cost: **$0**  
  - **Description**: Development will be carried out by our team members, leveraging existing knowledge and skills. No external developers are required for this phase.
  
- **Outsourcing (if needed)**:  
  - Estimated cost: **$X**  
  - **Description**: In case we need additional help (e.g., for specific tasks like advanced UI/UX), we will consider outsourcing development, but this will only be required if necessary.

## 2. üõ†Ô∏è **Software/Tools & Licenses**
- **API Usage (e.g., Google Maps, Twilio, Stripe)**:  
  - Estimated cost: **$0 to $50/month**  
  - **Description**: We are using free-tier APIs to reduce costs. However, should our usage exceed the free tier, additional fees may apply.
  
- **Design Tools (e.g., Adobe XD, Figma)**:  
  - Estimated cost: **$0 to $30/month**  
  - **Description**: Design tools are necessary for creating mockups and wireframes. We‚Äôll use free versions of these tools or minimal cost versions.

## 5. üì¢ **Marketing & Outreach**  
- **Initial Promotional Materials**:  
  - Estimated cost: **$0 to $50**  
  - **Description**: This cost covers materials like creating a demo video, basic website, or promotional designs to showcase the project.

---

## 6. üí° **Miscellaneous**
- **Contingency**:  
  - Estimated cost: **$10 to $20**  
  - **Description**: A small buffer to account for unexpected expenses, such as purchasing extra resources or tools that may arise during the project.
